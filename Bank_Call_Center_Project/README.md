# Project : IMPROVING BANK CALL CENTER OPERATIONS

* Objective: To improve the call center operations and to improve the performance to a level that is acceptable to the client.

* Solving the Exercises using six sigma methadologies.


**Exercise 1: Process Capability Indices**

**Objective:**
Determine the process capability indices for the performance metrics 'First Call Resolution' and '5 Day Resolution' using the data provided in Table 1.

**Steps:**
1. Calculate Cp and Cpk values for 'First Call Resolution' using the given specification limits (LSL=75%, USL=100%).
2. Calculate Cp and Cpk values for '5 Day Resolution' using the given specification limits (LSL=90%, USL=100%).
3. Interpret the process capability indices based on the calculated values.

**Summary:**
Conclusion: Cp and Cpk values for both 'First Call Resolution' and '5 Day Resolution' are less than 1. This indicates that the process is not capable according to Process Capability analysis. The process may need improvement to meet the specified requirements.

**Exercise 2: Measurement System Analysis (MSA) and Root Cause Analysis**

**A. What kind of data is shown in Table 2?**
The data provided is continuous data, representing the ratings given by QA analysts for voice recordings.

**MSA Method:**
The most appropriate method for MSA is the ANOVA method. Conduct a one-way ANOVA to verify the repeatability and reproducibility of QA results.

**B. Determine the potential causes for consistent failure to meet First Call Resolution targets.**
- Use tools like Fishbone or Ishikawa diagram for root cause analysis.
- Identify potential causes such as manpower issues, lack of standard operating procedures, obsolete technologies, and training deficiencies.

**C. Brainstorm and propose solutions for elimination of causes for failure.**
- Propose solutions such as improving recruitment processes, creating standardized procedures and knowledge bases, implementing automation and updated technologies, budgeting for training, and maintaining knowledge bases.

**Exercise 3: Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)**

**Objective:**
Identify potential failure modes and their effects for the solutions proposed in Exercise 2 using FMEA.

**Steps:**
1. Identify potential failure modes for each proposed solution.
2. Determine the effects of each failure mode.
3. Analyze the severity, occurrence, and detection for each failure mode.
4. Prioritize failure modes based on their risk.

**Summary and Conclusion:**
Use FMEA to systematically analyze potential failure modes and their effects for the proposed solutions. Prioritize actions based on the risk associated with each failure mode, aiming to address the most critical issues first.

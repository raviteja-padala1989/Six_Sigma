# Six_Sigma


* Six Sigma is a disciplined, statistical-based, data-driven approach and continuous improvement methodology for eliminating defects in a product, process or service.

Sigma represents the population standard deviation, which is a measure of the variation in a data set collected about the process. If a defect is defined by specification limits separating good from bad outcomes of a process, then a six sigma process has a process mean (average) that is six standard deviations from the nearest specification limit. This provides enough buffer between the process natural variation and the specification limits.

* #### What is Quality?
Different individuals and organizations have given different definitions for Quality. Let’s study some of those definitions:

Deming: "Quality is defined from the customer’s point of view as anything that enhances their satisfaction".

Juran: "Fitness for use. Those product features which meet the needs of customers and thereby provide product satisfaction. Freedom from deficiencies".

ASQC: "The totality of features and characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs".

COPC: "Quality is defined as knowledge of agents that would enable them to provide accurate and consistent solution to the customer at the very first attempt".

ISO: "Degree to which a set of inherent characteristics, of a product or service, fulfill requirements".


Simply stated, quality comes from meeting customer expectations. This occurs as a result of four activities:

Understanding customer requirements.
Designing products and services that satisfy those requirements.
Developing processes that are capable of producing those products and services.
Controlling and managing those processes so they consistently deliver to their capabilities.


* #### Why Six Sigma?
The creed for Six Sigma can be broken down into three assertions:

The continuous effort to achieve stability and a predictable result from a process is what makes a business successful.
There are characteristics to manufacturing and business processes that are definable and measurable. These characteristics can be analyzed to control and improve processes.
From the top-down, the entire organization must be committed to sustaining quality improvements for them to be achieved.
